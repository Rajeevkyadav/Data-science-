    "\" Unicorn Investors wants to make an investment in a new form of transportation - JetRail. JetRail uses Jet propulsion technology and Foursquare Location Data (API) to run rails and move people at a high speed! The investment would only make sense, if they can get more than 1 Million monthly users with in next 18 months. In order to help Unicorn Ventures in their decision, you need to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months. You are provided with traffic data of JetRail since inception in the test file.\""

    "\n",
    "##### There will be an increase in the traffic as the years pass by.\n",
    "Explanation - Population has a general upward trend with time, so I can expect more people to travel by JetRail. Also, generally companies expand their businesses over time leading to more customers travelling through JetRail.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The traffic will be high from May to October.\n",
    "Explanation - Tourist visits generally increases during this time perion.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Traffic on weekdays will be more as compared to weekends/holidays.\n",
    "Explanation - People will go to office on weekdays and hence the traffic will be more\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Traffic during the peak hours will be high.\n",
    "Explanation - People will travel to work, college."
